# Carbon Diary App
A mobile app that tracks usersâ€™ daily carbon emissions based on their activities, including travel, eating, shopping and waste separation. The app works like a carbon diary, allowing users to log or auto-track actions, and see their environmental impact through a simulated avatar. This app aims to raise awareness and encourage eco-friendly choices through positive reinforcement

The current calculations are just based on AI-generated data and rough research. Once Iâ€™ve developed part of the prototype, I will conduct more thorough research and include proper references.
